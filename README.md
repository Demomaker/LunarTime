# Purpose of this

Establish some form of lunar time, since moon exploration seems to be booming and might require lunar-only time some day.

## Self-determined characteristics of moon time

1. 1 moon year = 1 earth year, since the moon revolves around the earth and thus is brought around the sun at the same time as earth.

2. 1 moon day = 28 earth days, since the moon takes 28 days to go around the earth and perform 1 full spin on itself.

3. 1 moon year = 13 moon days, since 365 days divided by 28 days is approximately 13.

4. The current moon year count starts from the first observations or discoveries of the moon. For now, from a quick search, it has been established that Earth year 1609 is when the moon had its first telescope observations, so lunar year 0 = earth year 1609.

5. A moon day starts and ends at the full moon. (Full moon is earth day 1 of 28 in a moon day)

6. 1 moon minute = 1 earth minute

7. 1 moon second = 1 earth second

What this represents : 

Lunar 415 years = Earth 2024 years (first observations of the moon were in 1609 apparently, so 2024 - 1609 = 415)

Lunar day 2 = Earth day (29 to 56) (1 moon day is equivalent to 28 earth days)

Lunar time 400:14:3 = Earth time ((day 16 of 28) + 16 hours):14:03

So, if we want to convert this back into earth day year and time it would be : 

28 + 16 = 34

16:14:03, day 34 (february 3rd), year 2024
