### Purpose of This Project

As moon exploration and the possibility of lunar colonies grow more imminent, there may be a need for a timekeeping system specifically designed for the moon. The goal of this project is to establish a lunar time system that is consistent with the moonâ€™s cycles, facilitating both future lunar exploration and the potential establishment of human presence on the moon.

### Self-Determined Characteristics of Lunar Time:

- **1 Moon Year = 1 Earth Year**: The moon revolves around Earth, completing one full orbit around the Sun in the same time as Earth. Therefore, a lunar year corresponds directly to an Earth year.
  
- **1 Moon Month = 29.5 Earth Days**: The moon takes 29.5 days to orbit Earth and complete one full rotation on its axis. This period is used to define the length of a lunar month.

- **1 Moon Year = 12 Moon Months**: Since 365 days divided by 29.5 days is approximately 12, a lunar year consists of 12 lunar months.

- **Start of the Lunar Year**: Lunar year 0 begins in 1609, which is when the first telescope observations of the moon were made.

- **Moon Day**: A moon day starts at the full moon (Earth day 1 of a lunar month), and a lunar day is equivalent to 29.5 Earth days.

- **1 Moon Minute = 1 Earth Minute**: To keep it simple, we align lunar time with Earth time for smaller units like minutes and seconds.

### Example Outputs:

#### Example 1: Lunar to Earth Time Conversion

**Lunar Year**: 415 (Lunar year 415 corresponds to Earth year 2024)

**Lunar Day**: 2 (Lunar day 2 corresponds to Earth days 30 to 59 within the lunar month)

**Lunar Time**: 400:14:03 (Lunar time is calculated as 16 hours and 14 minutes on the 16th day of a lunar month)

**Earth Equivalent**: The corresponding Earth time is: February 13th 2024, 16:14:03
