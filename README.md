# Purpose of this

Establish some form of lunar time, since moon exploration seems to be booming and might require lunar-only time some day.

## Example of output :

What this represents : 

Lunar 415 years = Earth 2024 years (first observations of the mooon were in 1609 apparently, so 2024 - 1609 = 415)

Lunar day 2 = Earth day (29 to 56) (1 moon day is equivalent to 28 earth days)

Lunar time 400:14:3 = Earth time ((day 16 of 28) + 11 hours):14:03
